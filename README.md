Briefly, MAGORINO is a method for proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* estimation, which incorporates (i) Rician noiseâ€“based likelihood optimization based on the signal magnitude and (ii) two-point search of the likelihood function to ensure that both global and local optima are explored.

To use the method ot try any of the experiments in the paper, start by taking a look at the master script master.m in the 'Experiments' folder.
